### *Interview Questions*

- __*Question 2*__
  > Can you explain the thisArgs argument for the built-in map function in more? I think I understand, but I'm not 100% on the use cases or when it would be required.

### *Code Challenges*

- __*Question 3*__
    > In the prompt it states to create a function that 'logs' the index of the value with the first letter capitalized, but on class on Friday you explicitly stated that there shouldn't be any console.logs within the tests code challenges, could you please clarify. I completed the test but opted to return a value instead of log.
