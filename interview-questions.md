# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
   - Answer:
      > The difference between a prameter and an argument is that a parameter is a placehoder in the creation of a function and an arguement is data passed into a function where a parameter would then be fulfilled.

   - Researched Answer:
      > The difference between a parameter and an arguement is that parameters are the named placeholders for a value while creating functions. Once the function is created, the data that is passed into the function call would then be considered the function argument.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?
   - Answer:
      > The JavaScript built in method takes in value, index, and array. While they are all useful in different situations, value is the only required parameter out of the three. The index and array can be useful when finding an index of a value or returning full arrays are necessary. I recently realized that the exact terms aren't required to equal value, index, and array.
   - Researched Answer:
      > The JavaScript built in map method takes in one required parameter, a callback function. The callback function is made up of the value, index and array parameters, of which the value is the only required to build the callback function. The map method can take in a second arguement thisArgs, which can be used to reference the "this" reference of internal properties values of the callback function. If thisArgs isn't used, the predefined value of undefined will be used.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?
   - Answer:
      >In JavaScript there are multiple ways to iterate over arrays, two common ways are to use the built-in methods or higher order functions of map and filter aka (.map() or .filter()) these two methods can take in an array and complete a task on any item in the array. The main difference is that the map method completes the same code replication on every item in the array whereas the filter method only runs the supplied code on the items that meet the filtered requirements.
      The map function is great for ensuring all items in an array are returned whereas the filter method is great for filtering in or out items you need.
   - Researched Answer:
      > The primary difference between the map and filter method is that the filter methods callback function only returns if the statment provided returns true. The callback function on a map method runs on each item of an array as long as it exists.
